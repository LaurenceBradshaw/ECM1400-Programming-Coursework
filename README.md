# ECM_1400_CA_2022

Code for the ECM1400 Programming module of my degree.

The specification we were given was to create functions that filled the desired criteria. There were three sections to this: Reporting, Intelligence and Monitoring.

## Reporting
The reporting section consisted of two main parts.
1. Reading pollution data from a file and calculating statistics from it for a given pollutant.
2. Dealing with missing data in the file.

## Intelligence
The intelligence section consisted of two main parts. 
1. Reading an image of the roads in a city in and using the colours of the roads and creating a new image with just one set of the colours visable  
2. Finding the parts of the road that are connected to each other by using a path finding algorithm.

## Monitoring
The monitoring section consisted of using the LondonAir API to get statistics from monitoring stations. We were given free reign of what parts of the API we wanted to implement into the section.
