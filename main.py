# Questions:
# Can we make other functions that are not specified in the template? - does it matter what file we put them in?
# Can we import other libraries? Such as the regex library
# Why do you need both data and monitoring_station parameters in the functions in reporting.py? The way I see it is that you can read the data with the station name or just pass the data in, so why both?
